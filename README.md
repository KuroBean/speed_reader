# Flash and Bold Speed Reader
I found 2 different effects that allowed people to read faster on social media: flashing each word on the same part of the screen, and bolding the first syllable. This code combines these two to hopefully allow people slower at reading like me to read blocks of text faster. 
Just go to this website: https://speedreader-b3db7.web.app/ , copy and paste your text, and press play. Change parameters as needed. Coded mainly using Chat GPT.
